        Iâ€™m a Seattle based Software Developer
        with a true passion for creating outstanding content online. How I managed
        to find that passion (or end up in Seattle!) are a bit of a long story,
        but don't worry! &mdash; You can read all about it on the 'My Story' section!

        <br/>
        To give a quick overview of some of my driving philosophies, I believe no
        individual is greater than the sum of their tribe, everything should be
        built for mobile, and that so called "Dad Jokes" are the pinical of
        hilarity. I hope your time on my site allows me to proove these things.
